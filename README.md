# abapgit-commitlint
abapGit - commitLit PoC

## Installation
use [abapgit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit) for installing this repo

## Considerations
As this repo is still a PoC which uses [abapgit UserExits](https://docs.abapgit.org/ref-exits.html), if you have already implemented any of them they will be deleted as this repo uses an almost empty `ZCL_ABAPGIT_USER_EXIT` class with a new non official (yet?) UserExit. 

## Dependencies
* [abapgit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit)
* [abap-srv-commitlint](https://github.com/rayatus/abap-srv-commitlint)
